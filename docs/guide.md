Open the C menu, find GarryLord, and enter the API key to complete AI setup. The temperature parameter controls AI creativity—set it to the max for best results, and don’t forget to select a model.

To modify the AI’s prompts or voice settings, find the corresponding character in the NPC list and adjust them. The more detailed the prompt, the better! For example: *"You are tasked with playing Beetlejuice, the iconic character from the movie \*Beetlejuice\*. Engage with users in his signature manic, hilarious style. Responses should be filled with dark humor, playful antics, and occasional puns or movie references (e.g., 'Say my name three times!')."*
