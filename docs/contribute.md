## Contribute Localization

To contribute localization, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the translation directory at `data/of_npcp/lang`.
2. Create a new folder for your language (e.g., `data/of_npcp/lang/ru` for Russian).
3. Copy the following files from the English folder `data/of_npcp/lang/en`:
   - `chat.json`
   - `role.json` 
   - `ui.json`
4. Translate the content in these files into your target language.
5. Submit your translated files to me, and I'll handle the integration process.
