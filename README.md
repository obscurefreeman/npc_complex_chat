# üöÄ Become a Legend in GarryLord!

Every NPC will have a unique name, faction, and personality, and can interact with each other based on a vast pool of preset text. The coolest part? You can connect them to AI for lifelike conversational interactions! NPCs can autonomously read identity information, enabling rich dialogue experiences.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Setup Guide

## AI Configuration

- Visit your preferred AI platform (e.g., OpenAI) to apply for an API key.
- Open the C menu, find GarryLord, and enter the API key to complete AI setup. The temperature parameter controls AI creativity‚Äîset it to the max for best results, and don‚Äôt forget to select a model.
- Press E on an NPC and select the first dialogue option. Type your message in the text box and press Enter to send.
- To modify the AI‚Äôs prompts or voice settings, find the corresponding character in the NPC list and adjust them. The more detailed the prompt, the better! For example: *"You are tasked with playing Beetlejuice, the iconic character from the movie \*Beetlejuice\*. Engage with users in his signature manic, hilarious style. Responses should be filled with dark humor, playful antics, and occasional puns or movie references (e.g., 'Say my name three times!')."*

## TTS Configuration

- Log in to GitHub and locate the [garrylord-voice-service](https://github.com/obscurefreeman/garrylord-voice-service) project.
- Click the **Deploy** button on the project page to deploy the service on Vercel.
- Once Vercel deployment is complete, visit the generated page and copy the provided API address.
- Return to Gmod and paste the API address into the corresponding settings. Now, you can freely use the voice service in Gmod, enjoying a generous monthly bandwidth of 100G!
